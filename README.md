# MoTrPAC_PASS1B_TF_Paper

This repository contains the code necessary to generate the analysis and figures in the MoTrPAC Paper "Multi-omic identification of key transcriptional regulatory programs during endurance exercise training in rats"

All code files are included in the "R Code" subfolder. The omics normalized data, differential analysis, feature annotation files and sample metadata are available in the github repository MotrpacRatTraining6moData. Other essential files including Homer TF Enrichment outputs and CellCODE cell type deconvolution results are included in this repository under the "Data Files" subfolder.

The TFPaperDataSetup_112624.R file walks through converting MoTrPAC generated data files into the necessary formats used by the remaining files. Each file focuses on the analysis necessary to generate the associated figures and tables for the paper.
